Welcome to the Jazz documentation!

The Jazz docs are currently heavily work in progress, sorry about that!

## Quickstart

To get started, set up Jazz in your project. Here's how you can do that on your framework of choice:

- [React](/docs/project-setup/react)
- [Next.js](/docs/project-setup/next)
- [React Native](/docs/project-setup/react-native)
- [Vue](/docs/project-setup/vue)

Or you can follow this [React step-by-step guide](/docs/guide) where we walk you through building an issue tracker app.

## Example apps

You can also find [example apps](/examples) with code most similar to what you want to build. These apps
make use of different features such as auth, file upload, and more.

## Sync and storage

Sync and persist your data by setting up a [sync and storage infrastructure](/docs/sync-and-storage) using Jazz Cloud, or do it yourself.

## Collaborative values

Learn how to structure your data using [collaborative values](/docs/schemas/covalues).

## Get support

If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/utDMjHYg42).
We would love to help you get started.
