# Next.js

## Client-side only

The easiest way to use Jazz with Next.JS is to only use it on the client side. You can ensure this by:

- marking the `jazz.tsx` file as `"use client"`

<CodeGroup>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  ```tsx
  "use client"
  import { createJazzReactApp } from "jazz-react";// old

  const Jazz = createJazzReactApp();// old
  export const { useAccount, useCoState } = Jazz;// old

  import { PasskeyAuthBasicUI, usePasskeyAuth } from "jazz-react";// old

  function JazzAndAuth({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {// old
  const [passkeyAuth, passKeyState] = usePasskeyAuth({ appName });// old

  return (// old
  <>// old
  <Jazz.Provider// old
  auth={passkeyAuth}// old
  peer="wss://mesh.jazz.tools/?key=you@example.com"// old
  >// old
  {children}// old
</Jazz.Provider>// old
<PasskeyAuthBasicUI state={passKeyState} />// old
</>// old
);// old
}// old
```
</CodeGroup>

- marking any file with components where you use Jazz hooks (such as `useAccount` or `useCoState`) as `"use client"`

## SSR use (experimental)

Pure SSR use of Jazz is basically just using jazz-nodejs (see [Node.JS / Server Workers](/docs/project-setup/server-side)) inside Server Components.

Instead of using hooks as you would on the client, you await promises returned by `CoValue.load(...)` inside your Server Components.

TODO: code example

This should work well for cases like rendering publicly-readable information, since the worker account will be able to load them.

In the future, it will be possible to use trusted auth methods (such as Clerk, Auth0, etc.) that let you act as the same Jazz user both on the client and on the server, letting you use SSR even for data private to that user.

## SSR + client-side (experimental)

You can combine the two approaches by creating

1. A pure "rendering" component that renders an already-loaded CoValue (in JSON-ified form)

TODO: code example

2. A "hydrating" component (with `"use client"`) that

 - expects a pre-loaded CoValue as a prop (in JSON-ified form)
 - uses one of the client-side Jazz hooks (such as `useAccount` or `useCoState`) to subscribe to that same CoValue
 - passing the client-side subscribed state to the "rendering" component, with the pre-loaded CoValue as a fallback until the client receives the first subscribed state

TODO: code example

3. A "pre-loading" Server Component that

 - pre-loads the CoValue by awaiting it's `load(...)` method (as described above)
 - renders the "hydrating" component, passing the pre-loaded CoValue as a prop
